## Shared Preferences

  Shared preferences is used to cache data in the mobile's storage to prevent unnecessary calls to firestore which is important as the app scales and MAU's increase
  SharedPreferences is used to store the following user-scoped or date-scoped values:

| Key Pattern                          | Purpose                                  |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `hasWorkedOut_<userId>`             | Whether user worked out today            |
| `mood_<userId>_<YYYY-MM-DD>`        | Mood tracking for a specific date        |
| `goal_<userId>`                     | Current fitness goal for the week        |
| `goalWeek`                          | Week number in which goal was set        |
| `height_<userId>` / `weight_<userId>` / `age_<userId>` | Basic stats for analysis |
| `activeDates_<userId>`              | Dates user was active                    |
| `globalLastResetDate`              | Used to reset daily flags at midnight    |

---

### Utilities Provided

All SharedPreferences logic is abstracted under utility functions for modularity and readability. Here's an overview:

#### Daily Activity
- `hasWorkedOut()` / `setHasWorkedOut(bool)`
- `hasWorkedOutToday()` / `setHasWorkedOutToday(bool)`

#### Mood Tracking
- `setMood(String mood)`
- `getMood()` / `getTodaysMood()`
- `removeMood()`

#### Goal Management
- `setGoal(String goal)`
- `getGoal()` / `clearGoal()` / `clearWeeklyGoal()`

#### Active Days
- `setActiveDates(List<String>)`
- `getActiveDates()`

#### User Metrics
- `setHeight(double)` / `getHeight()`
- `setWeight(double)` / `getWeight()`
- `setAge(double)` / `getAge()`

#### Reset & Cleanup
- `checkAndResetDailyPrefs()`  
  Automatically clears daily flags (like mood/workout) from the previous day if the date has changed.
- `clearAllPrefs()`  
  Wipes all keys in SharedPreferences (admin/debug use).
- `clearCurrentUserPrefs()`  
  Clears only the current user's stored keys.
- `removePref(...)` and `removeCurrentUserPref(...)`  
  Safely remove any custom preference by key.

---

### Design Philosophy

- **User-Specific Keys**: Most data is stored per-user using UID suffixes to prevent clashes in shared environments.
- **Daily Reset Logic**: `checkAndResetDailyPrefs()` ensures data like mood and workout status is cleaned up daily.
- **Firebase + Local Sync**: Core persistent data remains in Firestore. SharedPreferences is used for fast access, offline UX, and temporary values.

---

- Sensitive or long-term data (like progress history, PR logs, etc.) should be stored in Firestore.
- SharedPreferences is purely local and should be treated as a performance layer, not a secure store.

## Firebase Setup
  TrackNTrain uses Firebase for:
- User Authentication (Email/Password and Google Sign-In)
- Firestore (for storing fitness-related data)
- Local caching via SharedPreferences (not part of Firebase, but complements it)

This guide explains how to set up Firebase for this Flutter app across Android and iOS, and how the `firebase_options.dart` and `google-services.json`/`GoogleService-Info.plist` files fit in.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Create a Firebase Project

- Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Create a new project (or use an existing one)

---

#### 2. Register App on Firebase Console

##### Android:

- Click "Add App" ‚Üí Select **Android**
- Use your Flutter app‚Äôs package name (e.g., `com.example.appname`)
- Download the `google-services.json` file
- Place it in your Flutter project under:

---

#### 3. Configure `firebase_options.dart` (Auto-Generated)

Install FlutterFire CLI (once globally):

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

then run

```flutterfire configure```

this wil auto-generate the ```firebase-options.dart``` file in the lib folder.

üîß Platform-Specific Configs
Android
In android/build.gradle (top-level):

```gradle
classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15' // or latest
```

In android/app/build.gradle:

```gradle
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    id("com.google.gms.google-services")
    id("kotlin-android")
    id("dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin")
}
```
in lib/ ```main.dart```

```dart
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'firebase_options.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Authentication

TrackNTrain supports secure user authentication using **Firebase Auth**, with both **Email/Password** and **Google Sign-In** options. The authentication layer is built using a service/provider structure for clean separation of logic and UI.

---

### Supported Authentication Methods

- **Email & Password Sign-Up and Login**
- **Google Sign-In (via OAuth)**
- **Account Deletion**
- **Sign-Out**
- **Auth State Listening** for real-time session handling

---

### File Structure (Authentication Logic)

| File                                         | Purpose                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `utils/auth_service.dart`                    | Base Firebase Auth wrapper (`FirebaseAuth.instance`) |
| `utils/auth_notifier.dart`                   | `ChangeNotifier` that tracks and updates auth state |
| `utils/normal_auth_utils.dart`               | Functions for email/password sign-up and login |
| `utils/google_auth_utils.dart`               | Google OAuth login logic                      |

---

### Auth State Management

The app uses a custom **`AuthNotifier`** class that listens to `FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges()` to automatically reflect authentication state changes in the UI.
This helps the app to automatically move to the login page in case the user's authentication state changes to not-authenticated.

```dart
class AuthNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  final StreamSubscription<User?> _authSubscription;
  User? _currentUser;

  AuthNotifier() {
    _currentUser = AuthService.currentUser;
    _authSubscription = AuthService.authStateChanges.listen((User? user) {
      _currentUser = user;
      notifyListeners();
    });
  }

  bool get isAuthenticated => _currentUser != null;
  User? get currentUser => _currentUser;
}
```

## Dio 

Dio is a package used to make HTTP requests to our external APIs to get responses. In this case our external APIs is nothing but the serverless backend hosted through Firebase Cloud Functions.
We have 2 endpoints

1. To handle the AI insight generation.
2. To handle user account deletion.

## Env Vars

When the app is set up for production it is not safe to store sensitive data like our endpoints to cloud functions here as they can be abused. Hence we write a config file like this. This way we pass the actual URLs during the build process where we create the ```.apk``` file for deployment to playstore.

```dart
class AppConfig{
  static const String aiUrl=String.fromEnvironment(
    'AI_INSIGHTS_URL',
    defaultValue: 'https://trackntrain-ai-insights.onrender.com/ai/meal-suggestion',
  );
  static const String deletionUrl=String.fromEnvironment(
    'USER_DELETION_URL',
    defaultValue: 'https://trackntrain-ai-insights.onrender.com/ai/delete-user',
  );
}
```

# Cloud Firestore rules
It is important to set rules for cloud firestore to prevent unauthorised access and writes and deletes. The app uses rules to ensure that any write, read, update and delete is performed only if authenticated and if the user requesting the service is the same as the document's owner. 

# Backend

Our backend just consists of serverless Firebase Cloud functions

A serverless Firebase Functions backend for a comprehensive fitness tracking application that provides AI-powered insights based on user health data.

## Data Processing Functions

The backend includes specialized preprocessing functions that transform raw user data into meaningful insights before AI analysis:

### preprocessWeights()
Analyzes weekly weight data to calculate:
- Minimum and maximum weights
- Average weight for the period
- Weight change from start to end of week
- Weight fluctuation patterns

### preprocessMood()
Processes mood entries to determine:
- Distribution across three states: energetic, sore, cannot workout
- Percentage breakdown of each mood state
- Dominant mood pattern identification
- Weekly mood trend analysis

### preprocessMeals()
Transforms meal logging data into structured summaries:
- Categorizes meals by type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
- Identifies most frequently consumed foods
- Generates comprehensive meal descriptions
- Calculates food consumption frequency patterns

These functions ensure the AI receives clean, structured data for generating accurate and personalized insights.


## AI Integration

The system uses Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model to generate personalized fitness insights. The AI analyzes:

- **Weight Trends**: Weekly weight changes and fluctuations
- **Mood Patterns**: Distribution of energetic, sore, and unable-to-workout days
- **Meal Analysis**: Food consumption patterns and frequency
- **Goal Alignment**: Personalized advice based on user's fitness goals

The AI generates conversational, coach-like feedback under 700 words, avoiding generic advice and providing specific, actionable insights.

This is what a sample prompt looks like 

```txt

 **Sample Response**
 ```txt
Hey!

Really awesome work this week ‚Äî you've already hit your weight loss goal by dropping 2 kg. That‚Äôs a solid achievement and it shows you‚Äôve been putting in the effort.

I did notice you‚Äôve been feeling sore on most of the logged days. That‚Äôs often a sign your workouts are pushing you, which is good, but it also means your recovery needs some attention. Make sure you‚Äôre stretching well, maybe try a light walk or some mobility work on your rest days. And don‚Äôt be afraid to dial things back slightly if the soreness is lingering ‚Äî recovery is part of progress.

Your breakfasts are looking great ‚Äî the oatmeal and protein shakes are exactly the kind of fuel your body needs in the mornings. Lunch was a bit all over the place this week, so if possible, try to bring a bit more balance there ‚Äî aim for some protein, veggies, and a complex carb in each meal. Dinner‚Äôs been solid, but adding a side of greens or fiber would really round it out.

As for snacks, the milkshake isn‚Äôt bad, but Chicken 65 ‚Äî while tasty ‚Äî is a little heavy on the fats. Maybe swap it once in a while for something lighter like fruit, Greek yogurt, or a handful of nuts.

Two things I‚Äôd really recommend focusing on this coming week:
First, prioritize your recovery ‚Äî soreness is a signal. Even just 15 minutes of stretching, foam rolling, or a gentle walk can make a big difference.
Second, don‚Äôt forget to hydrate ‚Äî especially with the kind of output you‚Äôre giving. Water plays a bigger role in recovery and energy than most people realize.

You‚Äôve clearly got the motivation ‚Äî just keep refining the process now. Really proud of how far you've already come. Let‚Äôs keep that momentum going.
```




## Error Handling

All endpoints include comprehensive error handling with:
- Input validation
- Firestore operation error catching
- AI API error management
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Appropriate HTTP status codes

## Security

- Firebase Authentication integration
- Input sanitization
- Secret management for API keys
- Batch operation limits for data safety


## Deployment 

Deploy your cloud functions using this command

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions: <name1> <name2>
```

While doing so firebase will prompt you for the SECRET (Gemini API Key) which will be stored in the Google Cloud Secrets Manager in a safe manner.

Any dependencies related to the cloud functions must be installed inside the ```/functions``` folder and not the root folder of the ```backend```.


# Future improvements

- Enabling push notifications for regular reminders and gamification.
- Inclusion of social features to create a more engaged community.
- Addition of exercise preview videos or GIFs to show how it is to be performed.
- Adding a ML model to verify form and correct the users to prevent injuries.
- Offline persistence and pushing to firestore when connected to internet later.
